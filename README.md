# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: forgetting to handle the base case properly. The `factorial.py` file contains a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. However, it does not handle negative input, which leads to a `RecursionError`.

The `factorialSolution.py` file contains a corrected version of the function that handles negative input gracefully.
